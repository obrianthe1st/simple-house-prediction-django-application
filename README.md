# simple-house-prediction-django-application
A simple application that shows how to combine django and a linear regression model.

It consists of two pages, a front page showing the model inputs and an output page where the result will be shown. 

The regression model was pretty rudimentary. It wasn't difficult coming up with everything. 

I got the data from Kaggle. 
The features are:
- date 
- price 
- bedrooms  
- bathrooms 
- sqft_living  
- sqft_lot 
-  floors  
- waterfront  
- view  
- condition 
- sqft_above
- sqft_basement  
- yr_built  
- yr_renovated
- street 
- city
- statezip 
- country
